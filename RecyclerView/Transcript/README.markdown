This sample Android app demonstrates
a `RecyclerView` in "transcript mode", where it appears as though new items are added at the bottom, scrolling upward, akin to a chat transcript.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on `RecyclerView`](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/recyclerview)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
