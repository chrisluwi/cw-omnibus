This sample Android app demonstrates
encrypting local files using an encryption key backed by the `AndroidKeyStore`.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on the `AndroidKeyStore` APIs](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/keys-and-the-keystore)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
